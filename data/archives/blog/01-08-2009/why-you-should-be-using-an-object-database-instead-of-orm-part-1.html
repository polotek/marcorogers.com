    <p><strong>I think traditional relational databases (RDBMS) are generally crappy for as the data store for complex dynamic web sites.</strong>&#160;
But despite the inflammatory nature of that first sentence, I'm going
to try not to turn this into a rant.&nbsp; Instead, I'll try to explain
the problems I see and why I came to that conclusion.</p>




<h2>The problem with RDBMS</h2>




<p>First of all, I don't have a problem with RDBMS.&nbsp; I think it
has served us very well up to this point and will continue to do so for
the forseeable future.&nbsp; It's a perfectly workable solution to the
problem of storing and retrieving persistent data.</p>




<p>I don't think anyone will take issue with that argument.&nbsp; So
what's wrong with relational databases?&nbsp; The answer has been
getting a lot of attention lately so I'll keep it simple and let
Wikipedia define it for me.&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_impedance_mismatch">Impedance Mismatch</a>.&nbsp;
I pretty much agree most of the points listed, and several of them can
be rolled up into one argument.&nbsp; Essentially, RDBMS doesn't fit
the object-oriented way we like to use data on the web.</p>




<p>The last sentence is important, because it puts some necessary
context on the argument I'm making.&nbsp; I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say that the majority of working web professionals have bought into
object-oriented programming.&nbsp; That's not to say most people
program this way.&nbsp; PHP is still the most popular web language and
many people still generate pages in a very top down imperative
way.&nbsp; (I'm one of those people who thinks PHP lends itself to this
style, but that's a different rant... I mean discussion).&nbsp; Also,
some functional languages like <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> are getting attention as being viable for web programming.</p>




<p>But whenever I see examples of people doing anything useful, I see a trend.&nbsp; <strong>We like to work with object-like data.</strong>&nbsp;
More and more websites are being built to provide access to bigger and
more complex collections of data.&nbsp; Movies on Netflix, People and
their friends on Facebook even boring stuff like all of Physicians in
your Insurance network under your employee health benefits plan.&nbsp;
So it's more and more essential for programmers to be able to create a
good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model">mental model</a>
of the data and how to work with it.&nbsp; Creating objects
representing these different data collections and then composing them
together seems to be the best thing going.</p>




<p>When using an RDBMS, in the simplest form, "object-like" just means
lists or arrays that represent rows in the database.&nbsp; This is
generally where PHP falls.&nbsp; You use PDO or some equivalent, write
your SQL statements and you can access your data like this.</p>




<p><code>$get_my_employee = 'select * from "Employee"';<br/>
$emloyee = $db-&gt;query($get_my_employee).fetch();  // simplified on purpose.  you get the point<br/>
echo $employee["First Name"];<br/>
echo $employee["Last Name"];<br/>
echo $employee["Spouse"];</code></p>




<p>Not too bad, except for that first bit, but it seems harmless enough
so lets ignore it for now.&nbsp; It's just a collection of related data
points representing some information on an employee.&nbsp; But things
are rarely this simple, and that last line looks suspicious too.&nbsp;
Because we're all about normalization and proper organization of our
data, we've split all of our Spouses into a separate table and linked
them through a foreign key. So making a long story short, that first
line isn't so harmless anymore.&nbsp; You have to do your join and
specify the fields you want and put your necessary filter clauses on it
until you get all your data in one fell swoop.</p>




<pre><code>$get_my_employee = 'select e."First Name", e."Last Name", e."Phone Number", ... s."First Name" from "Employee" e, "Spouse" s where e."SpouseID" = 'schmoopie' and e."SpouseID" = s."ID"...';</code></pre>




<p>I put in ellipses in place of some details to speed things
along.&nbsp; But depending on the complexity of your database schema,
those ellipses are hiding some headaches.&nbsp; Not to mention the fact
that you have two columns with the same name that represent different
data points ("First Name").&nbsp; It's left as an exercize for you to
determine which is which by adding even more code.&nbsp; Fun times.</p>




<p>But eventually you end up with one long array with the employee
you're interested in along with all the data about their Spouse as
well.&nbsp; You completed your task but the journey was a pain, and
don't even get me started on debugging and maintaing that long SQL
string.</p>




<h2>The Problem with ORM</h2>




<p>Okay, I think I made the last section a sufficiently irritating
explanation of what we already know.&nbsp; I wanted to go through this
to drive home a point though. Problems like this are the reason that
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is all the rage right now.</p>




<p>ORM allows us to take those nasty details and abstract them
away.&nbsp; We can get nice simple objects to work with and get back to
the real business of making our web page do something cool.&nbsp; More
importantly, it allows us to deal with the relationships between our
data items in a sane fashion.&nbsp; No more jumping through hoops to
get all of our data points into one row. &nbsp; Let's switch to
Python/Django just because I haven't worked with any PHP ORMs yet.</p>




<p><code><br/>
employee = Employee.objects.get(id=1)<br/>
print employee.first_name<br/>
print employee.last_name <br/><br/>
spouse = employee.spouse<br/>
print spouse.first_name</code></p>




<p>Ah, that's more like it.&nbsp; Even my non-programmer friends (who's
eyes glaze over when I talk about code) can piece together what's going
on here.&nbsp; And that first line replaces the previous unpleasantness
with all the ellipses. So what's my beef with this?&nbsp; On a
theoretical level, nothing.&nbsp; I'm a fan of Django precisely for
this reason. But from a more practical perspective, this sets off that
nervous twitch I get when something is way harder than it needs to
be.&nbsp; That RDBMS is still there.&nbsp; Lurking.&nbsp; The ORM
evangelists will respond with "yeah, but you don't have to worry about
it".&nbsp; First off, I call bullshit on that.&nbsp; It never works out
that way.&nbsp; But let's say we're drinking the kool-aid today and I
believe that.&nbsp; The spirit of ORM is to literally take something
that was designed to work a certain way (RDBMS + SQL), and take lots of
time and effort to make it work a different way (Objects + simple
filter functions).&nbsp; Wrapping it in layers of abstraction until it
doesn't even look like itself.&nbsp; Let's talk about some of the
problems.</p>




<h3>It's an Abstraction.</h3>




<p>When I first started looking at ORM, I thought this was a good
idea.&nbsp; Maybe because I was already working with objects as data on
a regular basis.&nbsp; One of the platforms I started out on was <a href="http://zope.org/">Zope</a>,
which is built on a datastore that represents actual Python objects
composed together in a manner of your choosing.&nbsp; It has it's own
issues, but in terms of web programming, it felt natural.&nbsp; It took
a while before I got "comfortable" with SQL. It has always felt, for
lack of a better word <em>icky</em>.  The developers of Django's ORM understand this.  If you look at the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/#spanning-multi-valued-relationships">documentation for Django Querying</a>,
the api goes through great pains to insure that you can avoid the
ickiness.&nbsp; You can represent almost any complex query without
writing SQL.</p>




<pre><code><br/>## The example assumes you have a Model representing a Blog and this has a number of Entries related to it.<br/>##  To select all blogs that contains entries with <em>"Lennon"</em> in the headline and were published in 2008, we would write:<br/>Blog.objects.filter(entry__headline__contains='Lennon', entry__pub_date__year=2008)</code></pre>




<p>I'm sure the last of my non-programmer friends have drifted away
after that. But if you are a programmer and you're trying to get a
handle on how this works, you run into the following bit of nastiness <em>before you even get to this example.</em></p>




<blockquote><p>To handle both of these situations, Django has a consistent way of processing <span class="pre">filter()</span> and <span class="pre">exclude()</span> calls. Everything inside a single <span class="pre">filter()</span> call is applied simultaneously to filter out items matching all those requirements. Successive <span class="pre">filter()</span>
calls further restrict the set of objects, but for multi-valued
relations, they apply to any object linked to the primary model, not
necessarily those objects that were selected by an earlier <span class="pre">filter()</span> call.</p><p>That may sound a bit confusing, so hopefully an example will clarify. (the above code example follows)</p></blockquote>




<p>Even the developers of one of the best schemes out there (in my
opinion) have to admit that they've got some crazy juju going on under
the hood.&nbsp; This is because they have to take what you're trying to
do and put the ick back into it.&nbsp; These simple filters get
translated into not so simple SQL.&nbsp; And to top things off, they
frequently try to help you along by giving you the equivalent example
in SQL.&nbsp; So you frequently end up doing double work.&nbsp;</p>




<ul>
    <li>Step 1) How would I do this with a complex SQL query?</li>
    <li>Step 2) How do I translate Step 1 to my nifty ORM api so I can get my data as objects?</li></ul>




<h3>It leaks</h3>




<p>The complexity of the ORM scheme leaves you wide open for leaky
abstraction problems.&nbsp; And often times, when you run into these,
you <a href="http://gasi.ch/blog/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">lose a lot of the time you saved</a> by using the abstraction in the first place.</p>




<h3>If it doesn't work, you're back where you started</h3>




<p>Is this really an acceptable trade-off to be able to work with
object-like data?&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; Hence the popularity of
Django and Ruby on Rails and Symphony (or whatever php framework is
actually in style these days)&nbsp; But to boil it down to the point of
this post.&nbsp; <strong>Why are we choosing to deal with this impedance mismatch when we don't really have to?</strong></p>




<p>In part 2 to this post, I'll take a shot at talking about object
databases and making a case that they should become a more common
addition to our web framework architectures.</p>

            <p>You could stick to SQL for matters of job security.  Many people I talk to simply say "I don't know databases." or "I can't do SQL." - I need to stop talking to these people.
<br/>
<br/>Seriously though, the point that stuck out to me was... "it allows us to deal with the relationships between our data items in a sane fashion"  I haven't gotten to work with a PHP ORM yet either - so if you do I hope you discuss it/them.</p>

            <p>I understand where you're cimnog from, but I have to disagree with your statement that  Django tries to be everything,  as I find the exact opposite to be the case.Django is amazing for what it does, and that is help you quickly develop dynamic websites.  If I have a new project, and it fits within the scope of Django's mission, I'll use Django every time.  If I'm bolting on functionality to an existing site, the Django probably isn't the right choice.  Likewise, if I'm using data from several sources, or trying to share a DB with another app, I'm not likely to go with Django.I've not used Pylons, as my first experience with Python was Django, but I'm surely looking for something more generic.  As it stands, if a site doesn't fit the mold, I'm falling back to PHP (CodeIgniter).  I like Python very much, though, and I will soon get around to deciding on a more all-purpose framework.  That could be Pylons, it could be TurboGears, Zope   Who knows?  No matter what I chose, though, Django will still be my  go-to  tool for rapid development.</p>
